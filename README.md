# HelloJavaUtils
newbie's first repository

Newbie in both Java and Git.

Just a try to join the opensource~

Maybe someday, I'll create a real helpful project.

## Chainmail:
A Example Of Singly Linked Lists

  Usage:
  
    //You can see it all at ChainMailTest
    //init
    Chain<Integer> chain = new Chain<Integer>();
    //add
    chain.add(2);
    //add to list front:
    chain.addToFront(999);
